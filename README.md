# What is DevOps?
what is DevOps? This word is combination of two words, Development and Operation.

**Development**: refers to design, coding, testing and deployment of Application. This process includes both front end and back end development of software and also include the necessary integrations of other services.

**Operations**: Operations refers to the management and maintenance of software applications or services in production environments. This includes tasks such as monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintaining the infrastructure and software components that make up the production environment. Ultimate , goal of DevOps is fasten the software cycle and available the software bug free and provide good experience to the end user of Organizations.

# DevOps Culture?

DevOps culture refers to the set of practices and values that underpin the DevOps approach to software development and delivery. A DevOps culture is characterized by collaboration, communication, and a shared sense of responsibility among all members of a software development organization, including developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders.<br>
**A DevOps culture emphasizes the following principles at its core:**

**Continuous improvement:** DevOps teams are constantly looking to improve their processes and practices, looking for ways to streamline workflows and reduce waste.<br>
**Automation:** DevOps emphasizes the use of automation tools to reduce manual work and increase the efficiency and reliability of software delivery.<br>
**Collaboration:** DevOps teams work closely together and focus on common goals and objectives to ensure that software is delivered quickly and reliably.<br> **Continuous Feedback:** DevOps emphasizes the importance of continuous feedback from users and stakeholders so that teams can respond quickly to changing needs and requirements.<br>
**Customer-centricity:** DevOps teams prioritize customer needs and expectations with a focus on delivering quality software and services that meet customer needs.

# Software Development Life Cycle?

SDLC is a systematic software creation process that ensures the quality and correctness of the software created. The SDLC process aims to produce quality software that meets customer expectations. System development must be completed within a predetermined period and budget. An SDLC consists of detailed plans that describe how a particular piece of software is planned, built, and maintained. Each stage of the SDLC lifecycle has its own processes and deliverables that lead to the next stage.

### To apply SDLC numbers of models are exist

**Water Fall Model**

**V-Model**

**Iterative Model**

**Spiral Model**

**Incremental Model**

**Agile Model**

# What is Waterfall Model?

First and oldest SDLC model, it’s work principle based on as water is falling from up to down and can’t go back. In the same way, first we gather the requirements of system and build the system. And if afterwards we want changes it can’t happen to system. This is Limitation of WaterFall Model.

# What is Agile Model?

This model overcome the drawback of WaterFall model. The Agile model is an iterative, incremental software development process that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. It replaces the traditional waterfall model that follows a sequential approach to software development.
In the Agile model, the software development process is divided into short iterations, typically lasting 2–4 weeks. Each iteration includes a complete cycle of requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. After each iteration, customer or end-user feedback is collected and the development team makes any necessary changes or updates to the software application.

### Benefits of Agile Model:

**Flexibility**

**Continuous improvement**

**Collaborative teamwork**

**Customer collaboration**

**Incremental delivery**

# Origin of DevOps?

Patrick Debois was interested in learning IT from every perspective and began working on a large data center migration. He realized that the frustrations experienced in projects such as these are from the constant switching back and forth between the development side of the problem and the silo of operations on the other side of the fence. Andrew Shafer tried to put together a meetup session, but Patrick was so excited to learn of a like-minded person that he hunted him down at the conference and had a talk in the hallway. They formed a discussion group for other people to post their ideas for how to solve this divide between development and operations later that year, but not much came of it.

John Allspaw and Paul Hammond gave a talk entitled “10+ Deploys a Day: Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr” in 2009, which sparked a call to have a gathering of developers and system administrators to discuss the best ways to start bridging the gap between the two fields. This event, DevOpsDays, garnered a fair amount of attention from experts in both fields and sparked lively debates over Twitter. In March of 2011, Cameron Haight of Gartner presented his predictions for the trajectory of DevOps over the next few years, leading to more attention for the movement and enterprises of all sizes adopting these new practices.
